# Vprofile-Project

**Project Overview**

Welcome to the V Profile Project setup. This project aims to establish a multi-tier web application stack locally on a laptop or desktop. The project provides a baseline for future projects, offering insights into deploying, containerizing, and managing web application stacks on platforms like Kubernetes. Additionally, it enables the creation of a personal lab for research and development (R&D), allowing users to practice with various technologies and enhance confidence in making changes to production-like environments.

**Objective of the Project**

1. **Establish a Baseline**: This project serves as the foundation for upcoming projects where we will deploy, refactor, containerize applications, and manage them using orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
2. **Build a Local Lab**: It enables the setup of a personal lab environment for practicing and conducting R&D on local machines. This reduces the risk of making errors on production servers and provides a controlled space for testing.

**Problem Statement**

Setting up a local project stack manually can be challenging due to its complexity, time consumption, and non-repeatable nature. Developers often lack the confidence to make changes on real servers due to the risk of breaking live environments. This project addresses these issues by providing an automated, repeatable, and consistent local setup using infrastructure-as-code principles.

**Solution**

To solve the above problems, the project uses an automated approach to set up the local stack. With tools like Vagrant and VirtualBox, we automate the creation and configuration of virtual machines (VMs). Using infrastructure-as-code principles, the entire stack can be recreated as often as needed. This approach simplifies R&D, makes the process repeatable, and enhances confidence in production changes.

**Tools Required**

1. **Hypervisor**: Oracle VM VirtualBox to run the VMs.
2. **Automation Tool**: Vagrant to automate VM creation and configuration.
3. **Command-line Tool**: Git Bash for executing commands and version control.
4. **Code Editor**: Sublime Text, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, or any preferred IDE.

**Services in the Project Stack**

- **Nginx**: Acts as a load balancer to route user requests to the Tomcat server.
- **Tomcat**: Hosts the Java-based web application.
- **RabbitMQ**: Acts as a message broker for queuing and messaging services.
- **Memcached**: Provides database caching for faster data access.
- **MySQL**: Serves as the main database for user data storage.

**Flow of Services**

1. **User Request**: A user opens a web browser and enters the IP address of the load balancer.
2. **Nginx Load Balancer**: The user's request is received by Nginx, which routes it to the Tomcat server.
3. **Tomcat Application Server**: Tomcat hosts the Java-based web application and handles user interactions.
4. **Memcached**: If data is requested from the database, it first checks Memcached to see if the data is already cached. If available, the data is retrieved from Memcached, reducing load on the MySQL database.
5. **MySQL Database**: If the requested data is not in the cache, it is fetched from MySQL. The data is then stored in Memcached to speed up future requests.
6. **RabbitMQ**: This service is included as a dummy service to introduce additional complexity, allowing for the practice of working with message brokers.

**Architecture and Design**

- **Virtual Machines**: VirtualBox will host multiple VMs for each service (Nginx, Tomcat, RabbitMQ, Memcached, and MySQL).
- **Automation**: Vagrant will automate the creation and configuration of these VMs, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
- **Scripts**: Batch scripts and commands will be used to automate the setup and configuration of the services on the VMs.

**Execution Flow**

1. **Setup Prerequisites**: Install VirtualBox, Vagrant, Git Bash, and a preferred IDE.
2. **Source Code**: Clone the source code from the Git repository and navigate to the Vagrant directory.
3. **Vagrant Setup**: Run the Vagrantfile to bring up the VMs automatically.
4. **Service Setup**: Set up and configure each service in the following order:
   - MySQL
   - Memcached
   - RabbitMQ
   - Tomcat
   - Nginx
5. **Application Deployment**: Build the Java-based web application and deploy it on the Tomcat server.
6. **Validation**: Verify that all VMs are running and interacting correctly, ensuring all services are operational.

**Benefits**

- **Automation and Repeatability**: Automating the stack setup ensures that the entire process can be replicated multiple times with minimal effort.
- **Research and Development**: By having a local lab, users can test changes without impacting production environments.
- **Hands-on Practice**: The project allows users to develop hands-on experience with popular DevOps tools and technologies, including Vagrant, VirtualBox, Nginx, Tomcat, MySQL, Memcached, and RabbitMQ.

**Conclusion**

The V Profile Project setup is a crucial foundational project for DevOps practitioners and developers. It provides hands-on experience with real-world tools, enabling automation, infrastructure-as-code, and service orchestration. By creating a local lab, users can develop confidence in deploying and managing production-like environments. The knowledge and skills gained from this project will serve as a basis for more advanced projects, including containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes.
